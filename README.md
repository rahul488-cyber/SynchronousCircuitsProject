# SynchronousCircuitsProject
This project contains HDL designs, MATLAB simulations, and presentations for various digital circuits, including flip-flops (JK, D, T) and synchronous systems. It showcases implementations and simulations of key digital components, with detailed K-maps and circuit diagrams.

Project Contents:

HDL Files: Designs for various flip-flop circuits and logic gates.

And.hdl, Or.hdl, Not.hdl: Basic logic gate implementations.

D15Synchronous.hdl, JK.hdl, T.hdl, JK15Synchronous.hdl, T15Synchronous.hdl: Flip-flop circuits (D, JK, T) and synchronous systems.

MATLAB Files: Simulations for flip-flop and master-slave circuits.

Dmasterslave.m, t_master_slave.m: MATLAB scripts for simulating flip-flop behavior in master-slave configurations.

PowerPoint Presentations:

cricuit_daigram.pptx: A presentation illustrating circuit diagrams.

k-map.pptx: A presentation on Karnaugh maps for logic simplification.

How to Use:-

HDL Simulations: Use an HDL simulator (like ModelSim or Vivado) to simulate the flip-flop and logic gate designs in the .hdl files.

MATLAB Simulations: Open and run the .m files in MATLAB to observe the behavior of master-slave flip-flop circuits.

Presentations: The PowerPoint presentations (.pptx files) provide visual aids for understanding circuit diagrams and logic design techniques.

Purpose:-

This project serves as an end-of-course project (EOCP) showcasing key concepts in digital logic design, including flip-flops, synchronous systems, and logic gate implementations. The simulations and diagrams provide a comprehensive view of how these components function in a digital system.
